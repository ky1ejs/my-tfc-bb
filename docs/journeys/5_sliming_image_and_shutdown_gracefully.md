After making some learnings on cut for slimming node images down, I wanted to apply them here.

Whilst tweaking the docker build, I noticed that when running my-tfc-bb it doesn't respond to ctrl-c. This got the better of me and I tried fixing it for about 4 hours.

Most of my motivation came from the fact that `cut`, a node service running in docker, shutdowns gracefully and quickly on ctrl-c, so I couldn't get why it wasn't happening here.

I matched many dependencies, node version, TS version etc. etc. I got to the point where I was going to replace `npm` for `pnpm`, as this is that cut runs with, when I ran into a plethora of import issues from the code generated by `ts-proto`. Lots of deps were missing (e.g. `long`), but were available when running with `npm`.

I did some googling for the latest Node + Docker + TypeScript setups and found that the toolchain may have moved on:

* https://buf.build/blog/connect-node-beta
* https://buf.build/blog/protobuf-es-the-protocol-buffers-typescript-javascript-runtime-we-all-deserve

The last link there had a nice comparison of the new `Protobuf-ES` generator/runtime and how it's better than `ts-node` and all the others:

At this point, it dawned upon me that this is too much work and I need to get back to `cut`. 

To be honest, I'm pretty fed up with fighting the gRPC toolchain for JS (also looking at you Buf, a massive pain in the ass to figure out how to get it running in the Dockerbuild process or in other CI processes)... I think I'll stick to GraphQL.

For now I'll just leave the service in a state where it has to be forced to shutdown, which I think is how it already was anyway iirc... I recall seing logs in Fly.io saying that it was being force shutdown or something like that...
